EC2 provisioning boiler plate
===

A little playground project to get a boiler plate for toying around with
terraform, VPC, ALB and subnets.

# How to use

- `install terraform`
- `terraform init`
- `terraform plan`
- `terraform apply`

# Kudos

See [this repo](https://github.com/benoutram/terraform-aws-vpc-example) to find
out where I go the inspiration from.
